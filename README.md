# üß† Wafer Scratch Detection (NI ML Assignment)

This repository presents a machine learning solution for a scratch detection task on semiconductor wafers, part of a technical assignment from **National Instruments**. The goal is to automatically identify **scratches**‚Äîelongated patterns of defective or seemingly good dies‚Äîon wafer maps using spatial data and die quality labels.

## üìå Problem Context

In semiconductor fabrication, wafers contain a grid of **dies**, each representing a circuit. Some dies fail quality checks due to physical defects such as **scratches**, which appear as continuous or fragmented lines. Detecting these defects is currently manual, error-prone, and inefficient.

This project proposes a data-driven approach to **automate scratch detection**, improving quality control and reducing inspection time and cost.

## üéØ Project Goals

* Detect dies associated with a **scratch**, even if the die is still marked as functional ("Ink")
* Build a robust model using wafer map features (X, Y, category, etc.)
* Predict scratch labels on an unlabeled test set and submit predictions
* Demonstrate practical skills in **feature engineering, modeling, and real-world ML deployment**

## üöÄ Methodology

1. **Data Analysis**
   Explored wafer layout, class distributions, and defect patterns.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   Created spatial features: normalized coordinates, die neighborhood structure, die counts.

3. **Model Selection**
   Benchmarked models:

   * `Random Forest` (baseline)
   * `LightGBM` (final model ‚Äì best performance)

4. **Cross-Validation Strategy**

   * Used GroupKFold to preserve wafer-level separation.
   * Optimized for **F1 score** to balance precision and recall.

5. **Prediction & Postprocessing**

   * Predicted die classes on test data
   * Refined predictions using die grouping and domain rules

6. **Submission**
   Generated `scratch_predictions.csv` for submission, formatted per spec.
